First I have create the api key in NYtimes 
Then create the iOS Project doing in swift and set the structure properly 
Install the SDWebImage for image downloading and alamofire for api hitting and object mapper for parse the data 
SVProgress Hud use for loader
Use the MVC pattern for this 
Like in viewController only get the data and populate it properly
